# 🌸 Flower Shop Project

**Flower Shop** is a full-stack web application for an online flower shop, developed as a capstone project for the "Basics of Object-Oriented Programming" course.

The project combines classic e-commerce functionality, strict object-oriented architecture, and the use of graph theory algorithms to calculate bouquet complexity.

## 1. Lab 1: OOP Basics
*Implementation of Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism requirements.*

The project implements a strict OOP architecture:

* **Classes & Objects:** Over **12 classes** implemented (minimum requirement: 9).
    * *Entities:* `User`, `Order`, `Payment`, `Shipping`.
    * *Products:* `ShopItem`, `Flower`, `DecorItem`, `Bouquet`, `SpecialBouquet`.
    * *Utils:* `Graph`, `Store`.
* **Encapsulation:** All classes utilize private fields (`#price`, `#items`, `#status`). Access is controlled via getters and validation methods (e.g., `User.setShippingAddress` validates string length).
* **Inheritance (Hierarchies):**
    1.  `ShopItem` (Base) → `Flower`, `DecorItem`, `Bouquet`.
    2.  `Bouquet` → `SpecialBouquet` (Deep hierarchy, 3 levels).
    3.  `Shipping` (Abstract) → `NovaPoshtaShipping`.
* **Polymorphism:**
    * **Dynamic:** The `getDescription()` method is overridden in `Flower`, `DecorItem`, and `SpecialBouquet` classes. The `calculateCost()` method is overridden in `NovaPoshtaShipping`.
    * **Static (Generics Simulation):** The `Store` class implements a container that accepts only objects inheriting from `ShopItem` (using `instanceof` checks).
* **Non-trivial Methods:** Over 25 complex methods implemented, including `findOptimalFlowerConnections` (graph algorithm), `processPayment`, and `updateStatus`.

## 2. Lab 2: Graphical User Interface (GUI)
[cite_start]*Implementation of interactive user interaction [cite: 98-101].*

The interface is decoupled from business logic (Frontend in `frontend/`, Backend in `backend/`).

* **Screens (Forms/Windows):** **6 pages** implemented (minimum requirement: 4):
    1.  `index.html` (Home)
    2.  `products.html` (Catalog with filters)
    3.  `details.html` (Product Details)
    4.  `cart.html` (Shopping Cart)
    5.  `checkout.html` (Order Checkout)
    6.  `builder.html` (Bouquet Builder)
* **Controls:** Over **25 elements** used (minimum requirement: 20):
    * Filters: by color (radio buttons), seasonality (toggle), price (inputs), search (text input).
    * Drag-and-Drop zone for the builder.
    * Quantity controls (+/-), Add to Cart, Remove buttons.
* **Data Containers:** Dynamic population of product lists (`.product-list`), cart items, and builder components.
* **Event Handling:** Event listeners implemented for `click`, `input`, `submit`, `dragstart`, `drop`, `dragover`, `DOMContentLoaded`.

## 3. Lab 3: External Libraries
*Integration of third-party solutions to enhance code quality.*

A detailed retrospective report can be found here: [📄 LAB3_REPORT.md](./LAB3_REPORT.md)

**Libraries Used:**
1.  **`validator` (v13.12.0)**:
    * Used on the backend for input sanitization (XSS protection) and email validation during order processing.
2.  **`date-fns` (v4.1.0)**:
    * Used in the `Order` class for precise delivery date calculations (adding days, date formatting).

## 4. Academic Project
*Implementation of unique functionality and domain analysis.*

A detailed market and analog analysis can be found here: [📊 ANALYSIS.md](./ANALYSIS.md)

**Key Project Features:**
* **Bouquet Builder:** A unique feature distinguishing this project from typical flower shops. Users can custom-build a bouquet by dragging and dropping flowers (Drag & Drop).
* **Algorithmic Component (Graph Theory):**
    * Flowers are represented as **Graph Vertices**, and their compatibility as Edge Weights.
    * **Kruskal’s Algorithm (MST - Minimum Spanning Tree)** is used to calculate the optimal "Assembly Cost" based on the compatibility of selected components.
    * This solves the "Black Box Pricing" issue by transparently explaining the composition complexity to the user.
