🌸 Flower Shop OOP Project
This is a full-stack web application for an online flower shop, created as a project for the "Object-Oriented Programming Basics" course. The project consists of a Node.js backend that provides a REST API and a vanilla JavaScript frontend that implements the graphical user interface.

Project Requirements Compliance Report
This project was developed to meet the specifications outlined in the "General Requirements" and "Lab 2: GUI" documents.

General Requirements (0.general-requirements.docx)
The project successfully implements all major general requirements for the course.

The OOP design is central to the application. The codebase makes extensive use of OOP principles, including encapsulation (using private fields # in classes), inheritance (e.g., ShopItem as a base class for Bouquet and Flower), polymorphism (e.g., the getDescription() method), and abstraction (e.g., the Shipping base class).

The code is strictly separated by concern. The backend directory contains all business logic, data classes (entities, products), and the API server, while the frontend directory contains all GUI-related code (HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript). The project runs as a single program (node backend/server.js), which serves both the API and the static frontend files.



Modern software engineering practices have been followed. Source control (Git) was used throughout the development process, with regular commits to a remote GitHub repository. Unit tests are included (tests/oop-tests.js) to verify core class functionality, which is a mandatory requirement for the highest evaluation. Internationalization (i18n) has been implemented, with the entire frontend UI and all backend server responses being translated to and displayed in English.





The project also leverages external libraries, with express and cors being used in the backend to build the REST API. Error handling is implemented on both the server-side (using try...catch blocks in API endpoints) and the client-side (handling fetch promises and form validation). Finally, the project defines clear interfaces, including a Web GUI for users and a REST API for programmatic access.




Lab 2: GUI Requirements (1.2.a.lab2-gui-generic.docx)
The project fulfills all quantitative and qualitative requirements for the second laboratory assignment on GUI development. It follows the "Implementation of educational projects (independently)" variant on the Web platform.


The application features 6 distinct screens (exceeding the minimum of 4):

Home Page (index.html)

Category Page (products.html)

Product Details Page (details.html)

Shopping Cart Page (cart.html)

Bouquet Builder (builder.html)

Checkout Page (checkout.html)

In total, there are over 23 unique control elements (exceeding the minimum of 20). This includes 4 color filter buttons, a seasonal toggle button, a price filter toggle, 2 price range inputs, a search input field, 2 quantity buttons, 3 "Add to Cart" buttons, multiple "Remove from Cart" buttons, drag-and-drop elements, and 5 form controls on the checkout page.

The project features 3 container elements that are dynamically populated with data (exceeding the minimum of 1): the main product list (.product-list), the cart items list (#cart-items-list), and the available components list in the builder (#available-items-list).

There are well over 15 event handlers implemented (exceeding the minimum of 10). The application responds to DOMContentLoaded, click (for all buttons and filters), input (for search and price fields), dragstart, dragover, dragleave, drop (for the bouquet builder), and submit (for the checkout form).

Finally, the project maintains a strict separation of logic and GUI. The frontend JavaScript files are responsible only for handling user events and rendering data. All business logic,  such as price calculations, bouquet complexity analysis (kruskalMST), and order processing, is handled exclusively by the backend classes and server.
